### TO-DO

- [ ] We have missing data in `total_bedrooms`, take care of these
- [ ] `ocean_proximity` attribute is an **object** type, we need the prepare for model
- [ ] `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`, `population`, `households`, `median_income` attributes right skewed. We need to transform these to have more symmetrical and bell-shaped distributions
- [ ] `median_house_value` -target value- is capped out $500.000, we need to restore for ML
- [ ] We need to scaled dataset correctly
